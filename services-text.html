				PBS International LTD!

			<p>You need fresh and reliable labour, but you don’t know where to look for it?</p>

			<p>Or you’ve already started the recruitment, but you feel lost among the tons of incoming CVs and you’d rather entrust someone else with this time-consuming and energy-intensive process (of selection, filtering, interviews etc.)?</p>

	<p>Are you looking for hardly obtainable / hard-to-get professionals for a specific field or top managers?</p>

	<p>Whichever is your problem, you’ll find the solution at PBS International Ltd. Our profile includes complex labour exchange, direct search, involves making interviews, asking for references and the evaluation and notification of candidates. As it is very important for us to find the best employee for our clients indeed, we give a 3-6 months guarantee for each of our allotted candidates in all services.

			<h2>
				Complex labour exchange
			</h2>
			<p>In fact it is a full service combination of recruitment and selection. You only have to make the final decision between the professionally and personally filtered and selected 3-4 most appropriate candidates.</p>

<p>As a first step of complex labour exchange, we seek for candidates in our database whom meet our client’s requirements and given criterias, and we send newsletters for our registered users about the details of the position, as well. In the meantime we post job advertisements on those on-line forums, where the target group is most accessible. This is followed by a personal interview where our qualified experts examine the chosen candidates’ personality, language skills and professional experience in details and if our client demands, they will test their professional or special language knowledge. After the interview we check the candidates’ professional background, collect references, which is facilitated by our knowledge of the market and our extensive connection networks. Thereafter, we send you the CVs accompanied by a detailed analysis of those 3-4 candidates, who are perfect in every aspect to fill the vacancy. We arrange the personal introductions for the date(s) that you’ve appointed. After you’ve chosen those, who are the most suitable for the position, we inform all the candidates about the decision. Generally, this takes the most of the time, but it is indispensable, as it will reflect badly on a company, if it leaves their candidate without an answer – whether it is positive or negative. Especially in those cases, when some of the rejected candidates will later be considered for another position.

			<h3>
				Direct search (headhunting)
			</h3>
			<p>If you are looking for professionals for a specific field or you’d like to lure over middle-level or top managers to your company, we recommend direct search. It is a discreet procedure, where the given position is not announced via advertisements, but we get to the convenient candidates through references and our knowledge of the market. We should not forget that they are most likely not active job-seekers, so it has a great importance to work out the motivation package together with the client. We ask for a detailed description of the position, regarding every professional and personal requirement, which is important for our client. We make the list of the preferred companies from which the client would welcome candidates, and a “prohibitive list” about those companies from which we mustn’t call candidates (e.g. the partners). After these we get in contact with the candidates without revealing our principal. Then we restrict the number of potential candidates and on a personal interview we check their CVs, the authenticity of their references and we also analyse their professional knowledge and personal attributes. After the interviews, we review and send you the CVs of those 2-3 candidates, who are perfect to fill the vacancy in every aspect. We arrange the personal introductions for the date(s) that you’ve appointed. After you’ve chosen those, who are the most suitable for the position, we inform all the candidates about the decision. This step should not be neglected, as it will reflect badly on a company, if it leaves their candidate without an answer – whether it is positive or negative. Especially in those cases, when some of the rejected candidates will later be considered for another position.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Follow-up
			</h3>
			<p>Our job doesn’t end with the delivery of the perfect candidate. We are at the disposal of our candidates and clients as well, whether it is about newly occurred requirements or a helping hand at contract negotiations or any other consultancy in connection with human resource.
